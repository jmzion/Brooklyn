New York City is a hotspot for travel. Brooklyn is one of the more popular boroughs to visit. We can learn more about people traveling to Brooklyn by looking into the listings of Airbnbs in Brookyln. We analyzed the data of Airbnb listings in. NYC for 2019 to draw conclusions about Brooklyn and the guests who travel to this great borough.  

As a group we learned about Brooklyn but individually we focused on our own neighborhoods. Jean Zion worked on Williamsburg and Fionna Du worked on Flatbush, two popular parts of the borough.
