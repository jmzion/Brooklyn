For this assingment, we looked through the websites Street Advisor, Brick, DNAInfo, and Niche to asses our neighborhoods. There is some contradiction on which neighborhood rank higher overall. Whereas Niche ranks Williamsburg higher, StreetAdvisor prefers Flatbush. Based on the three most important qualities that we chose (safety, transportation, and recreation), the two neighborhoods fare pretty equally. Though Flatbush itself wasn't on the DNAInfo list, a neighboring area, East Flatbush, was rankef 8 spots higher than Williamsburg. Regarding transportation, both boroughs have an "A" ranking on Niche for commute and have accessible subway lines. Williamsburg has an edge over Flatbush since it is closer in proximity to Manhattan. Regarding recreation, both neighborhoods have an "A" in Outdoor Activities on Niche, but Williamsburg has an "A+" in nightlife, whereas Flatbush has an "A". Williamsburg also has more attractions than Flatbush, which makes it more appealing. Overall, Williamsburg ranks higher than Flatbush as a place to stay at an Airbnb.

The Airbnb listings in Brooklyn make up 44.1% of total listings in NYC, which is a sizable chunk considering the fact that there are five boroughs. The prices of Airbnbs in Brooklyn are relatively expensive. Only Manhattan is more expensive than Brooklyn, though by a moderate margin. Brooklyn's listings have the second highest minimum night stay, hinting that they cater more to longer-term rentals. Somewhat surprisingly, the average number of total reviews and reviews per month in Brooklyn are one of the lowest, exceeded only by Manhattan. Considering the sheer number of Airbnb listings in Brooklyn, it is possible that many of these listings have not yet been rented out or received reviews yet. This is mirrored by the fact that Manhattan has the lowest rates of reviews and reviews per month, despite the greatest number of Airbnb listings than any other borough. Though Manhattan has the greatest number of listings, Brooklyn is the most booked. It has the least availability out of any other borough.
