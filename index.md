New York City is a hotspot for travel. Brooklyn is one of the more popular boroughs to visit. We can learn more about people traveling to Brooklyn by looking into the listings of Airbnbs in Brookyln. We analyzed the data of Airbnb listings in. NYC for 2019 to draw conclusions about Brooklyn and the guests who travel to this great borough.

For this assingment, we looked through the websites Street Advisor, Brick, DNAInfo, and Niche to asses our neighborhoods. There is some contradiction on which neighborhood rank higher overall. Whereas Niche ranks Williamsburg higher, StreetAdvisor prefers Flatbush. Based on the three most important qualities that we chose (safety, transportation, and recreation), the two neighborhoods fare pretty equally. Though Flatbush itself wasn't on the DNAInfo list, a neighboring area, East Flatbush, was rankef 8 spots higher than Williamsburg. Regarding transportation, both boroughs have an "A" ranking on Niche for commute and have accessible subway lines. Williamsburg has an edge over Flatbush since it is closer in proximity to Manhattan. Regarding recreation, both neighborhoods have an "A" in Outdoor Activities on Niche, but Williamsburg has an "A+" in nightlife, whereas Flatbush has an "A". Williamsburg also has more attractions than Flatbush, which makes it more appealing. Overall, Williamsburg ranks higher than Flatbush as a place to stay at an Airbnb.
